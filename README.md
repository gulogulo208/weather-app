# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## App Purpose

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`. This is using a new API key, emailed to the repo's owner.

## Functionality 

Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name.

App uses `localStorage` to store any previous searches on the client-side. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
